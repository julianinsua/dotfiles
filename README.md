## Nvim
### Dependencies
I am using null-ls for some specific diagnostics, also it's using vim-prettier. This means that you'll need some stuff installed besides what Lazu already installs automatically. Here's a list
- [ ] write-good
- [ ] cspell
- [ ] codespell
- [ ] prettier (also yarn for vim-prettier)

    > I still need to figure out debugging with nvim-dap. In the mean time I'm using vimspector. But I don't like it.
## Tmux
This is a bit trickier to link because the default config location is not on the `~/.config` folder. Instead it needs to be on the home directory (`~/`).

## Zsh
I'm using oh my zsh and the theme is powerlevel10k. You'll need to install the shell, the oh-my-zsh plugin and the theme.
